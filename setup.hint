ldesc: "gd is a C graphics library created by Thomas Boutell that allows 
your code to quickly draw complete images with lines, polygons, arcs, 
text, multiple colors, cut and paste from other images, flood fills, 
read in or write out images in the PNG, JPEG or GIF format.

Lua-GD is a binding: a library that exports gd functions to the Lua
Programming Language, allowing you to use gd from Lua."
